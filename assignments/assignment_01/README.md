# Assignment 1. Life expectancy
 
 In this assignment, you will create the "before" figures. At the end of this course, you will return to this exercise and recreate all the figures using the tools that you have learned. 
 
 Use any tool you like to create what you think is the best visual answers to the following questions.
 
## 1.1 Life expectancy of a group of countries in 2014
Data file `life_expectancy.csv` contains life expectancy data for many countries over a wide range of years. Use the data in this file to extract 2014 life expectancy in your country and in five more countries that belong to the same group, organization or geographical region. Feel free to define any selection criteria you want. For example, since I live in Israel, I will select the following OECD countries from the Europe & Central Asia region with the highest 2014 life expectancy: Spain, Switzerland, Italy, France, Luxembourg, Israel.

Create a visual representation of 2014 life expectancies in the countries you selected.
 
## 1.2 Life expectancy dynamics over the time (1)
Obtain the life expectancy data for the countries in the previous section for the widest time period available. Show a comparison between the expectancy dynamics of your country to other countries in that group. 

## 1.3 Life expectancy dynamics over the time (2)

Expand the list of countries so that it contains between 20 and 40 countries. For example, all the OECD countries. Repeat the previous task with the extended data set.
